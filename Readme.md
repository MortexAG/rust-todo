Super Simple Task List

This README was generated by an AI because I was too lazy to write it myself ðŸ˜…

A minimal command-line task manager written in Rust.
Features

    Add tasks

    List tasks

    Delete tasks

    Mark tasks as done

    Edit task names

    Tasks are saved persistently in a JSON file (tasks.json)

Usage

Run the program with different commands:

# List tasks (default)
cargo run -- --action list

# Add a task
cargo run -- --action add --task "Buy groceries"

# Delete a task by ID
cargo run -- --action del --id 3

# Mark a task as done by ID
cargo run -- --action done --id 2

# Edit a task name by ID
cargo run -- --action edit --id 1 --name "New task name"

Development

    Uses clap for command line parsing.

    Tasks are saved/loaded from tasks.json in the current directory.

    Write tests under tests/ folder for integration testing.

    The code is modularized into task.rs for core logic.

Testing

Run all tests with:

cargo test
